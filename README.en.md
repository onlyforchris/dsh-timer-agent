# dsh-timer-agent — Scheduled-jobs × AI Agent engine for DSH

[中文](./README.md) | English

A [DeepSeek Harness (DSH)](https://github.com/) Web GUI plugin: a **host-resident scheduled-jobs engine** built after studying the cron system of [NousResearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) and following its "timer ↔ agent coordination" design. It is live the moment the `dsh web` service starts — **it keeps firing with the GUI page closed**.

## What it does

At each cron due point (5-field cron) it executes your prompt through a **real agent session**:

- **Pin an existing session** → every run continues that conversation with full context (hermes-cron continuity semantics)
- **Set a project workdir** → every run starts a fresh session inside that project (its AGENTS.md loads automatically)
- **Leave both blank** → every run starts a new conversation in the default workspace

Manage jobs right from any conversation with the `timer_agent` tool (create / list / update / pause / resume / remove / run); the web GUI sidebar「定时任务」panel manages the same jobs — **one ledger, three doorways** (tool / WebUI / file).

## Two job kinds

- **AI Agent job** (default): each fire drives a real agent session executing your prompt; consumes API quota
- **Command job**: each fire spawns `command + args` you specify (optional workdir and timeout) — **no AI, no quota**; exit code plus the tail (≤16k chars) of stdout/stderr lands on the execution record. Great for self-contained scripts (downloads, exports, credential renewal)

> [!WARNING]
> **Command jobs execute arbitrary commands on your machine with your current user privileges — no sandbox, no allowlist.** Anyone who can create/edit jobs (you, any agent session able to call the `timer_agent` tool, any local process that can reach the loopback API) can schedule arbitrary programs. Only schedule commands you have reviewed and that are safe to run unattended; do not expose this plugin to untrusted environments; a tampered `jobs.json` ledger is equivalent to arbitrary local code execution. **Use with care.**

## Architecture (isomorphic to hermes-agent cron)

```

Run settlement rides `session/event` (`turn/end`'s `reason.kind`); failure reasons land verbatim in the ledger.

## Features

- **Scheduling**: 5-field cron (min hour day month weekday; `*`, `*/n`, `a-b`, comma lists) + preset dropdown (daily 09:00 / hourly / every 10 min / Mondays 09:00) on both create and edit surfaces
- **Three schedule modes**: a dropdown on the create form — Cron / fixed interval / one-time (right after the schedule toggle, disabled while unchecked); fixed-interval grids stack whole periods from the last trigger and never drift across restarts
- **One-shot jobs**: a single run instant (defaults to now + 1h) that fires once and auto-archives — success, failure, and a manual "run now" all consume the shot; ideal for finish-and-forget scripts and reminders
- **Editable next run**: interval and one-shot jobs allow hand-editing the next run instant; cron stays strictly expression-driven (server-refused)
- **Pause / resume semantics**: pausing keeps the stored next run; resuming recomputes from the REAL last execution and skips missed occurrences straight to the next future slot
- **Target tree picker**: collapsible per-project groups, each with a "new session" leaf plus the project's existing sessions (most recent first); picking a session pins that conversation
- **Jobs board**: list (title/status/next-run/run count), search, detail view (cron editor, execution history, jump to session transcript, run now, reset, delete)
- **Model tool**: `timer_agent` in any conversation creates and manages the same jobs
- **System-prompt injection**: the host half registers a `plugin:timer-agent` announcement section so agents know the capability
- **Safety**: API routes are loopback + same-origin only (same fence as dsh-ssh)

## v0.5.0 changes & backward compatibility

**Changes**

- The execution model now depends **entirely on the persisted next-run instant** (`nextRunAt`): cron / interval only compute it; a due instant fires
- New **one-shot jobs** (`runAt` on create / `run_at` on the `timer_agent` tool): one fire, then the job archives; a manual run consumes the shot too
- **Pausing no longer clears** the next-run instant; **resuming** recomputes from the real last execution (`executions` last `startedAt`, falling back to `lastTriggeredAt`) without replaying missed runs
- Interval / one-shot next-run instants are hand-editable (PATCH `nextRunAt` / tool `next_run_at`); cron refuses manual instants by design
- Skip-once is meaningless for a one-shot (skipping == not running): the UI hides it and the server refuses

**Backward compatibility**

- **No ledger migration needed — upgrade in place**: cron / fixed-interval / paused rows from v0.4.0 and earlier survive untouched; blank legacy rows are still dropped (as before) and a corrupted ledger still degrades instead of crashing
- Old code paths could never write a one-shot-shaped row (blank cron AND no interval WITH an instant), so no pre-existing job can be misclassified as one-shot and auto-archived
- Only caveat: after upgrading, **rolling back** to v0.4.0 makes the old validator drop one-shot schedules (those jobs become unscheduled); cron / interval jobs are unaffected

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add link:<absolute path to this directory>
```

Then **restart `dsh web`**; the sidebar「定时任务」entry confirms it is live (browser-side changes need a `Ctrl+F5` force refresh).

## Build

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run build      # lib/index.js (host) + lib/client.js (browser, CSS inlined)
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm test           # 49 behavioral E2E checks (fake host faces, no dsh runtime)
pnpm run smoke-test # static structure smoke (23 checks)
```

The E2E suite covers: cron parsing and next-run computation (local-time semantics), ledger atomic writes and corrupted-file degradation, at-most-once due firing, pinned-session resume, `turn/end` success/failure settlement (failure reason lands verbatim), skip-while-running, disabled schedules never firing, the manual-run fast path, workdir propagation, every `timer_agent` tool action (incl. invalid-argument rejection), and HTTP route CRUD + run + loopback/same-origin fencing + 400s on bad input.

## Mapping to hermes-agent cron

| hermes-agent | this plugin |
|---|---|
| in-process 60s ticker in gateway | 60s ticker in the `dsh web` host process |
| fire → new AIAgent(platform=cron) session | `agents.create`/`resume` real dsh sessions |
| ~/.hermes/cron/jobs.json ledger | ~/.dsh/timer-agent/jobs.json (atomic writes) |
| at-most-once (advance next_run_at first) | roll nextRunAt forward before firing |
| claim dedup + heartbeat | skip-while-running + 5s manual-run fast path |
| deliver backfill / platform pinning | pinned session / workdir new session / default space |
| cron_hint → notepad → script prompt assembly | self-contained prompt (no human present) |
| turn/end reason.kind=error settlement | same-shape session/event settlement |

## Compatibility, dependencies & permissions

**Compatibility** (declared in package.json):

- DSH: `0.1.1-rc.2` (exact `compatible` via `dsh.compatibility.dshReleases`; other releases unverified = `unknown`)
- Node.js: `>=22` (`engines.node`; the repo's tests rely on Node 22+ type-stripping)
- OS: verified on Windows 10/11; macOS/Linux unverified

**Dependencies**:

- Single runtime dependency `schemastery` (config schema validation), installed with the package; no install/postinstall/prepare lifecycle scripts
- `@deepseek-ai/*` and `react` are peerDependencies provided by the dsh host; the plugin never disables, replaces, or re-installs official components
- No install-time builds, downloads, or remote installs; the `lib/` build output is committed alongside the source

**Permissions** (the four signals visible to static source scanning — all required by plugin features):

- **Files**: atomic read/write of the jobs ledger `~/.dsh/timer-agent/jobs.json` (store); never touches dsh core directories or other profiles
- **Commands**: `command`-kind jobs spawn the command the job author configured (optional workdir cwd, inherits host `process.env`); `prompt`-kind jobs execute through the dsh session API and never open a shell
- **Network**: localhost only — the web GUI calls same-origin `/api/dsh-timer-agent/*` routes and the host talks to the local dsh service via the dsh client; no external services
- **Credentials**: spawned children inherit host `process.env` (dsh credentials reach the CLI via env vars); the plugin itself never reads, logs, or persists credentials or secrets

**Failure bounds**: a stopped service process fires nothing (missed means missed); a corrupted ledger degrades to an empty table with the original file backed up; a mid-run due slot skips; manual and ticker triggers share one at-most-once channel and never double-execute.

**Source anchor**: v0.5.0 released at commit `88ce4c30f54a257143dd80262cf7044aff431372`.

## Known limits

- Firing depends on the `dsh web` service process being alive (a stopped service fires nothing; after restart only already-rolled-forward due jobs run — missed means missed)
- A job that is mid-run at its due point skips that slot and waits for the next cron match
- Executions consume API quota; scheduled runs have no human present — prompts must be self-contained and must not ask questions
