/**
 * Sessions-service adapter: narrows the client runtime's injected sessions
 * service to the SessionsControllerFace the board consumes.
 *
 * Cordis boundary rule this module exists to enforce: the ctx object is a
 * proxy where ONLY names declared in `inject` resolve — any other property
 * read throws `cannot get property "<name>" without inject` and an eager
 * read at apply time fails the whole web boot ("failed to apply loader
 * entry"). Callers must therefore resolve `ctx.sessions` (declared) once and
 * hand the plain service object here; nothing in this file ever touches the
 * proxy itself.
